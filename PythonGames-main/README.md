# PythonGames
This is a collection of games that i have worked on over some time. They are written in 100% Python and are base frameworks for a list of games.
Some of the games are not fully completed and have various bugs but over time the games will get more complex. My main goal is to great some fun games that i can enjoy on my free time. I plan to update Mutus Magic mostly when I have free time, as this is a hobby project.

## Fully Completed
**Mutus_Magic_v1.1.4.py** is a Python-based GUI role-playing game where players explore a fantasy world, fight bosses, earn gold, level up through an XP system, and trade with a magical merchant named Merv. Built with `tkinter`, it offers a retro-inspired RPG experience for all skill levels.
### 🎮 Features
- 🧙 Character creation with class and stat distribution.
- 🗺️ World map with distinct locations and bosses.
- 🐉 Unique boss fights with turn-based combat.
- 💰 Merchant system to buy potions and sell rare loot.
- 🎒 Inventory management with potion use.
- 💾 Save/load game to/from disk.

- 💀 Game over screen with restart or load options.

## Partly-Completed
**Magic8ball.py** is a Normal 8 ball with options that are randomized then displayed if landed on a array of numbers between 1-8. No input needed other then run the program. It will display something like:
Try again later
  or
YES

**JOKES.py** is a collection of jokes, totaling 25 jokes. Will add more later down the road. Very simple jokes that do need an imput from the user.

**zizag.py** is a printed statement in a while loop that moves back and forward on the terminal to create a cool image. No imput from the user.

**CoinFlips.py** is a coin fliping game. It asks for the users input on how many times out of 100 & 1000 come out heads.
